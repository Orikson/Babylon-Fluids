# Babylon Fluids

A program built in Babylon.js to render and simulate fluids in an Augmented Reality space. Designed for the Microsoft Hololens 2.

Since moved to, and then finished at, the following Babylon.js playground; https://playground.babylonjs.com/#SKPYC3#39

See how the rendering works (third order texture filtering); https://playground.babylonjs.com/#7XYM60#22
